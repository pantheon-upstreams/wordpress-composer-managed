# This file contains .gitignore rules that are often used with Composer-based
# WordPress projects. Because .gitignore is specific to your site and its
# deployment processes, you may need to uncomment, add, or remove rules.

# The /web/app/ directory is used in favor of /wp-content in a traditional
# WordPress project. This is where files are uploaded to, where plugins and
# themes are installed and where other writeable directories are created.
# Plugin, theme and mu-plugin paths are defined later and handled differently,
# but in most cases, we don't want to version control anything in here.
# It's unlikely that you would need to change any of these rules.

# WordPress is installed in web/wp so that it can be fully managed by Composer.
# This ensures that the WordPress directory is clean and doesn't contain any
# files other than those that come with the WordPress package.
web/wp
web/.htaccess

# Our Composer post-install command creates a symbollic link to web/wp inside
# web. We don't want to version control these linked files, so we ignore them
# explicitly.

# Logfiles should always be ignored.
*.log

# Environment (.env) files should be ignored as they are generally personal.
# However, the .env.example and .env.pantheon files are left so that they can be
# viewed and modified. You should not store any credentials in your
# .env.pantheon file. Instead, those can go into environment-specific .env
# files. Constants saved in .env files will override those constants that are
# defined in wp-config-pantheon.php.

# Generally you should only ignore the root vendor directory. These files are
# managed by Composer and should not be version controlled. It may be necessary
# to explicitly allow /vendor directories within plugins or themes that are not
# available through Wpackagist (which mirrors WordPress.org), like projects
# that pull from Packagist or custom GitHub repositories.
/vendor

# Any local WP-CLI rules should not be version controlled.

# Must-use plugins
# Ignore packages uploaded to mu-plugins by default. These area typically
# managed by composer as wordpress-muplugins. If you have custom mu-plugins,
# you will need to explicitly exclude them from this rule like this:
# !web/app/mu-plugins/my-muplugin/
# By default, individual mu-plugin files are not ignored, so any bare file in
# mu-plugins is version controlled. Exceptions to this rule are made to specific
# files managed by Composer.
web/app/mu-plugins/*/

# Plugins
# Ignore the plugins directory by default. WordPress plugins should be managed
# by Composer, where we have more control over the version constraints of the
# plugins. If you have custom plugins, you will need to explicitly exclude them
# from this rule like this:
# !web/app/plugins/my-plugin
web/app/plugins/*
!web/app/plugins/.gitkeep

# Themes
# We don't ignore all themes by default as these are most commonly where a
# bulk of a site's custom code may be. However, we do ignore all of the
# twenty-* themes by default. Any other Composer-managed themes should be
# added to this list.
web/app/themes/twenty*

# Other WordPress files and directories
# Any other files or directories that should not be version controlled go here.
# A lot of stuff from the non-Composer-managed WordPress upstream is repeated
# here.

# Private files
# We want to ignore files inside web/private/ by default, but we don't want to
# ignore the entire directory. The web/private/config directory is excluded from
# this rule because this may contain information that should be shared across
# environments and is not considered sensitive data. However, that exclusion
# should be removed if that is not the case.
